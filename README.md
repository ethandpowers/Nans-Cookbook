# Nan's Cookbook

Live at www.nanscookbook.com

I was inspired to build this app after some friends and family had to adopt sever dietary restrictions to to health reasons.  Since my Nan is the best cook that I know, I thought it would be fitting to name this project after her.

This site allows the user to search/discover recipes that adhere to their dietary restrictions.
Note: I cannot guarantee the accuracy of these recipes or the efficacy of the ingredient filtering.  Please double-check the recipe before consumption.
